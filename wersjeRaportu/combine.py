# --- How to Use ---
# 1. Replace the placeholder paths below with your actual project path and desired output file name.
# 2. Using raw strings (r'...') for Windows paths is recommended to avoid issues with backslashes.
# 3. Run the script from your command line (e.g., python your_script_name.py).

# Example usage (replace with your actual paths):
project_directory = r'P:\Projects\GITHUB\RBD2\rbd_nowa'
output_text_file = 'combined_source_code.txt' # You can change the output file name if needed
combine_dotnet_source_to_txt(project_directory, output_text_file)
